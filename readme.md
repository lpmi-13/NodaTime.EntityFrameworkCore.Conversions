# NodaTime + EntityFrameworkCore (2.1.0+)

## What is this?

This repository contains an a netstandard project which has example implementations of type conversions, introduced in EntityFrameworkCore 2.1.0, that allow EntityFramework to understand and convert NodaTime types to usable types in EntityFramework. 

## Is this a Nuget Library?

No, not yet. I'm not sure if this is entirely Nuget library worthy. If you'd like to see this become a library raise an issue and it'll get sorted.

## What do I need to use these features?

You'll need to ensure your project is using EntityFrameworkCore 2.1.0 or later.
